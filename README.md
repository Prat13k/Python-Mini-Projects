###### Bagels: 
In this project i have written a python program to develop The Game of Bagels. In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on the clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: "Pico" when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, "Fermi" when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and "Bagels" if your guess has no correct digits

###### Birthday Paradox :
In this project i have written a python program to determine matching birthdays. The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance of two people having a matching birthday. But even in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent chance of a matching birthday. This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experiments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.
